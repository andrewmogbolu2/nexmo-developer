Send a Facebook message
=======================

You can then use the Messages API to respond to the inbound message received from the Facebook User.

Replace the following variables in the example below with actual values:

|Key | Description|
|-- | --|
|`FB_SENDER_ID` | Your Page ID. The `FB_SENDER_ID` is the same as the `to.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.|
|`FB_RECIPIENT_ID` | The PSID of the user you want to reply to. The `FB_RECIPIENT_ID` is the PSID of the Facebook User you are messaging. This value is the `from.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event on your Inbound Message Webhook URL.|

> **TIP:** If testing using Curl you will need a JWT. You can see how to create one in the documentation on [creating a JWT](/messages/code-snippets/before-you-begin#generate-a-jwt).
