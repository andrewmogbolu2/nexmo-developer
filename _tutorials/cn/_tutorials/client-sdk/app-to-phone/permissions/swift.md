Project permissions
===================

As you'll be using the microphone when making a call, you need to request the permission to use it.

`Info.plist`
------------

Every Xcode project contains an `Info.plist` file containing all the metadata required in each app or bundle  - you will find the file inside the `AppToPhone` group.

A new entry in the `Info.plist` file is required:

1. Hover your mouse over the last entry in the list and click the little `+` button that appears.

2. From the dropdown list, pick `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` and add `Microphone access required in order to make and receive audio calls.` for its value.

Your `Info.plist` should look like this:

![Info.plist](/images/client-sdk/ios-voice/Xcode-permissions.jpg)

Request permission on application start
---------------------------------------

Open `AppDelegate.swift` and import the `AVFoundation` library right after where `UIKit` is included:

```swift
import UIKit
import AVFoundation
```

Next, call requestRecordPermission:` inside `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: :

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission { (granted:Bool) in
        NSLog("Allow microphone use. Response: %d", granted)
    }
    return true
}
```

Build and Run

---

You can now build and run the project, by either selecting `Product` > `Run` from the top menu, or pressing `Cmd + R`, and launch it in the simulator.

Notice the prompt asking for permission to use the microphone:
