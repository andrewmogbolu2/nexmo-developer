The starter project
===================

To make things easier, a starter project is provided for you.

1. Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-voice-app-to-phone) (Android Studio `New project from version control` feature canâ€™t be used, because repository contains two projects `kotlin-start` and `kotlin-complted`).

2. Open the `kotlin-start` project in the Android Studio:

   1. Navigate to the menu `File -> Open`
   2. Select the `kotlin-start` folder from cloned repository and click `Open`

```

**3\.** Make project `Build -> Make Project`. If `Make Project` button is disabled please wait until Android Studio will finish parsing the project (progress will be displayed in bottom right corner of the Android Studio).
