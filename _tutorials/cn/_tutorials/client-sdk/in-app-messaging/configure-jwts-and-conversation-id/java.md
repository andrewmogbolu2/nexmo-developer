title:  Configure JWTs and conversation id
description:  In this step you learn how to add JWT to the application and set the conversation id.

---

Now it's time to fill previously generated `CONVERSATION_ID` and `JWT` tokens.

Open `Config.kt` file and replace placeholders with real values:

1. `CONVERSATION_ID` - id of the conversation created in the previous step
2. `ALICE_TOKEN` - Alice JWT token
3. `BOB_TOKEN` - Bob JWT token

```kotlin
package com.vonage.tutorial.messaging

public class Config {
````
public static String CONVERSATION_ID = ""; // TODO: set conversation Id
````
    public static User getAlice() {
        return new User(
                "Alice",
                "" // TODO: "set Alice JWT token"
        );
    }
````
public static User getBob() {
    return new User(
            "Bob",
            "" // TODO: "set Bob JWT token"
    );
}
}
```
````
Notice that these constants and values are hardcoded to store the properties of users. This makes it easier to use these values later in this tutorial.
