--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xcode project and workspace
===========================

You will be using the iOS Client SDK library inside an Xcode project you'll create next.

Create an Xcode project
-----------------------

* Open Xcode and, from the menu, select `File` > `New` > `Project...`.

* Select a `Single View App` for the Application type and click `Next`.

* For the `Product Name` type in `AppToAppChat`, select the relevant `Team` and `Organisation Identifier`.

* User `Objective-C` for `Language` and `Storyboard` for `User Interface`. Click `Next`.

* Select the `Desktop` as the place where your project folder will reside. You can select a different location but please make sure to remember it as you'll need to navigate to it soon from the `Terminal`.

* You now have a brand new Xcode Project.

**Before continuing, please close the new project you've just created.** 

You will add the iOS Client SDK library to your project via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

Install CocoaPods
-----------------

* Open the `Terminal` app and navigate to the project folder by typing:

```shell
cd ~/Desktop/AppToAppChat
```

* Install CocoaPods in your system, if you don't have it already:

```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Note: CocoaPods is built with Ruby, available by default on macOS.

* Create a Podfile for your project:

```shell
pod init
```

Add the iOS Client SDK
----------------------

* Add the Vonage iOS Client SDK to the Podfile. To do this, let's open it in `Xcode`:

```shell
open -a Xcode Podfile
```

* Update the Podfile as shown below:
````
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'AppToAppChat' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for AppToAppChat
  pod 'NexmoClient'
  
end
````
* Install the library:

```shell
pod install
```

The latest version of the library will be added to your project:
````
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing NexmoClient (2.2.1)
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `AppToAppChat.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
Pod installation complete! There is 1 dependency from the Podfile and 1 total pod installed.

[!] Automatically assigning platform `iOS` with version `13.5` on target `AppToAppChat` because no platform was specified. Please specify a platform for this target in your Podfile. See `https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#platform`.
````
Open the workspace

As described in the output above, please use `AppToAppChat.xcworkspace` rather than the initial project from now on. To open it, type the following in the terminal:

```shell
open AppToAppChat.xcworkspace
```
