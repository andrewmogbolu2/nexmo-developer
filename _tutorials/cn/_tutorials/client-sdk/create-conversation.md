Create a Conversation
=====================

Create the [Conversation](/conversation/concepts/conversation) that users will use to communicate with each other.

```bash
nexmo conversation:create display_name="CONVERSATION_NAME"
```

The output is similar to:
````
Conversation created: CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab
````
Make a note of this newly generated conversation Id (`CON-...`). You will use it later to add [Users](/conversation/concepts/user) to the [Conversation](/conversation/concepts/conversation) as [Members](/conversation/concepts/member).
